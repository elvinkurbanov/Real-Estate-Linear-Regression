# Real-Estate-Linear-Regression
Real Estate Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project applies linear regression to predict real estate prices based on key features such as location, size, number of rooms, and age of the property. The dataset is analyzed, cleaned, and split into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is trained to understand the relationship between features and price, and performance is evaluated using metrics like RÂ² and RMSE. The goal is to build a simple yet effective model for price estimation.
